        <h1>Been There</h1>
        <h3>By: Ryder</h3>
        <p>
            Assignments came in thousands of dates near the last termâ€™s ending. <br>
            Had to spend numberless hours, numberless nights doing assignments. <br>
            Minutes before the due date, I was doing last-minute refinements. <br>
            I felt very stressed before the date and very nervous after handing in. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this trouble, tension, and mental strain, I figured out a way. <br>
            I had many friends and a lot of fun walking, talking, and playing for fun. <br>
            Quick and easy through my many assignments, school was nearly done. <br>
            Now here, I'm writing this poem that you are reading right now, today! <br>
