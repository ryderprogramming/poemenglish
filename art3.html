        <h1>High School At First Artist Statement</h1>
        <h3>By: Ryder</h3>
        <p>
            “High School at First” is a free verse poem, about the start of my first day of high school. It loosely follows the iambic pentameter to give itself tone to the words in it. This uses an ABABC rhyming scheme, which is a common scheme used in poetry.
The poem uses similes to show how nervous I was on the first day of High School. In the fourth line, the poem states “I was as nervous as a baby bird in the sky”. Birds are well known for learning how to fly, but first they must fall and overcome their fear. This is a simile to summarise the move from Elementary School to High School.
It was made to show the start of High School at Corinda State High School, specifically.
