        <h1>Library Artist Statement</h1>
        <h3>By: Ryder</h3>
        <p>
            My poem, “Library” is an Ode about the library, which shows my devotion to the library. The poem uses an ABBC rhyming scheme in the quatrain. The Ode is about the books in the library, specifically. “Library” uses metaphors to describe the books. For example, the poem has “books are like the red, tender apples of a tree”. This metaphor refers to the knowledge you can receive from the books of the library, reflecting it with the apples of a tree. The poem also uses allusion in the line “teach us something useful please”. Interestingly, the line refers to a popular book named Harry Potter, referring to the Hogwart’s School Song. This is because Hogwarts is a school which educates and inspires; this is similar to a library because it does the exact same. The Ode is meant to show the reader a great place to study and learn during their times at Corinda State High School.
