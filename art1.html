        <h1>Been There Artist Statement</h1>
        <h3>By: Ryder</h3>
        <p>
            My poem, "Been There", is a ballad poem, which unlike most ballads, is not about love. It is about my school problems and how I solved them. The poem uses different structures for each stanza to differ itself from the Traditional English Ballad. "Been There" mostly uses repetition and alliteration to emphasis the pressure in high school. For example, "Numberless nights, numberless days" is repetition, alliteration, and a hyperbole all at once. The repetition causes a recurring thought in the readers head, which shows the trouble of assignments. The hyperbole, used in the same statement, emphasises how much you had to spend to get assignments. This ballad is supposed to leave the reader with a clear message about the stress and fun you can get from high school, using all of the techniques in this ballad.
